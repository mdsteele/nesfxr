# nesfxr

An [SFXR](https://www.drpetter.se/project_sfxr.html)-like sound generator for
the NES.

## Building

To compile, first
[install cc65](https://wiki.nesdev.org/w/index.php/Installing_CC65), then run
`make`.  The ROM file will be placed at `./out/nesfxr.nes`, and from there can
be loaded into an NES emulator.
